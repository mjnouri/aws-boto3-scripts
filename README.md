AWS and Python scripts

/left-mfa-at-home - Switched mobile phone and didn't move over IAM virtual MFA over. Conveniently had a locked down Amazon Linux 2 EC2 running with Administrator account access for scripting across the environment. Deleted MFA device with scripts, logged into the console, listed, deactivated, and deleted old MFA and created a new one.
